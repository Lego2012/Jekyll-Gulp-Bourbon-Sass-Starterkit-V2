### The file `_grid-settings.scss` in folder `_assets/_bitters-adjusted`

This file is as modified version of `_grid-settings.scss` in folder `_assets/_vendor/base/` which has been automatically installed. In that file the paths must be modified if your not on Rails. To make this an automatic process we simply copy this file to `_assets/_vendor/base/`.

This is done automatically by our `./install-dev.sh`.
